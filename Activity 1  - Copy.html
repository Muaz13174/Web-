       A paragraph is a fundamental unit of written text, usually consisting of several sentences, that develops a single,
        coherent idea or topic. Paragraphs are marked by indentation or spacing and serve to organize content, making it easier
        for the reader to understand the author's thoughts by breaking a longer text into manageable, structured segments. A
        well-structured paragraph typically includes a topic sentence, supporting details or examples, and a concluding
        sentence, all working together to convey a clear point.
